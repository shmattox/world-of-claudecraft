 * what the lock does NOT prove is WHOSE commit removed it: after this
 * transaction's rollback a rival retry can land the delete before this read,
 * and then both requests run the (idempotent) success side, which is the
 * right answer either way. The row still present, or the verify itself
 * failing, leaves the original failure standing: the refusal stays
 * retryable, and a retry re-answers honestly.
 *
 * The read WAITS the in-flight transaction out instead of racing it: a READ
 * COMMITTED snapshot taken while the hung COMMIT is still applying sees the
 * deleted-but-uncommitted row as PRESENT, so a plain SELECT here answered
 * "not landed" for a delete that then committed, the client's retry got a
 * 404, and the world-state purge never ran (permanent orphaned market
 * listings and Ravenpost mail), widest exactly under the contention that
 * expired the wall mid-COMMIT. FOR KEY SHARE queues behind the deleting
 * backend's row lock until that commit resolves and then answers
 * definitively either way: a committed delete fails the EvalPlanQual
 * recheck and returns zero rows; an abort leaves the surviving row, which
 * this read shares and returns (see CHARACTER_DELETE_VERIFY_SQL for why
 * KEY SHARE and not FOR UPDATE). The wait is bounded by lock_timeout in
 * its own transaction; an expiry propagates the ambiguity honestly,
 * exactly like a failed checkout.
 *
 * One deliberate exception to the module's account-parent-first lock rule:
 * this transaction takes NO accounts lock. That is safe because it takes
 * exactly one row lock and never waits while holding another, so it cannot
 * close a deadlock cycle against the save path, a rival delete, or a
 * storage-purchase start; any future second lock added here must rejoin
 * the parent-first hierarchy. Runs while the delete permit is still held,
 * so the wait rides the delete's own admission and never stacks over the
 * sub-cap; the cost of that is TIME, stated honestly: an ambiguous delete
 * extends its permit hold past the 65s wall by up to the checkout bound
 * plus the 15s verify statement bound (about 85s worst case), so two
 * simultaneously ambiguous deletes hold both sub-cap slots for that window
 * and further deletes refuse retryably.
