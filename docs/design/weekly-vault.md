# Weekly Vault

A dedicated stone hall stands at (21, -119), facing west toward Eastbrook.
The Vault Keeper at (12, -119) opens weekly rewards through Talk or Interact.
The level entrance joins a short detour in the coast road. Pale stone columns,
slate pavilion roofs, a carved portal and gold trim frame the large steel door.
Bursar Fernando and all bank storage remain at the Gilded Strongbox. The vault
occupies most of the screen and closes bags; opening bags closes the vault.

## Weekly choices

Activities unlock candidate items, not additional item grants. At the Crucible's
weekly reset, each unlocked slot becomes available to open. Opening rolls and saves
one item before revealing it. The player inspects these fixed items and chooses ONE
across all four rows. Confirming an item consumes
all other candidates from that earned week. Current-week progress stays separate.
Older unclaimed weeks retain their choices; collecting one reveals the next week.
Opening, reconnecting, saving and loading never reroll an existing batch.

This follows Blizzard's [Great Vault carryover rules](https://eu.support.blizzard.com/en/article/279635)
and [raid pool unlock rules](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23935248).
Modern WoW replaced PvP with world activities, as described in its
[War Within overview](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24025828).
This implementation retains the owner's four requested rows, with WoC's own
content and equipment tiers:

- Raids: 1, 2 and 3 final-boss clears, including repeats of the same encounter.
  The first, second and third best clears determine each choice's difficulty.
  Defeating a boss separately unlocks its loot at that difficulty for future vaults.
- Dungeons: 1, 4 and 8 clears. The first, fourth and eighth best clears determine
  each choice's difficulty. WoC supports Normal and Heroic tiers.
- World quests: 2, 4 and 8 completions. Every rotating world quest turn-in counts
  once, through the same once-per-cycle claim guard the quest itself uses; story
  quests never count. The row pays the catch-up shelf: every Normal drop of the
  previous raid tier (Nythraxis, item level 29), ungated by raid kills and with no
  Heroic rung, filtered to what the character's class can wear.
- PvP: 1, 3 and 5 ranked arena or rated battleground wins. Practice matches,
  developer-ended battlegrounds and forfeits do not count. King of the Hill also
  counts one win for every player who stood inside for at least a minute for the
  group that held the hill longest, when that group held it for at least ten
  minutes in total, and is still in that group when it falls
  (`docs/design/warfare.md`, King of the Hill). The row reads "PvP Wins" for
  that reason.

The window shows actual candidates with quality, item level and tooltips; current
progress and exact eligible loot pools remain below. New rolls exclude every item
already fixed in the same week's vaults, including hidden or pending-save rewards.
Each remaining eligible item has equal probability within its pool. A later week
can roll the same item again. Existing saved rewards stay unchanged, including
duplicates rolled before this rule. Equipment must be usable by the character's class.
Legendary chase drops, quest items and non-equipment are excluded.

New rolls and possible-loot lists share class stat restrictions. Warrior, Rogue
and Hunter exclude any equipment granting Intellect, Spell Power or Healing Power,
including mixed-stat pieces. Warlock excludes all equipment granting Healing Power.
Druid, Shaman and Paladin have no stat exclusions. Mage, Warlock and Priest retain
their cloth armor and weapon proficiency rules; jewelry remains eligible. All
classes retain equipment and explicit class restrictions. Already saved rolls stay
fixed and do not reroll when eligibility changes.

### Choosing loot tables

Each unopened dungeon or raid vault starts with "Select which table to roll off" and requires
an explicit selection. Players may select several tables or Select all. Dungeon
options combine the cleared bosses in each dungeon; raid options remain per boss.
Only bosses the character has cleared are offered at the vault's difficulty:
a Heroic clear also unlocks Normal, never the reverse. Boss unlocks are permanent;
new weekly batches freeze them at the end of the earning period. Intermediate
boss kills unlock loot without adding a dungeon-clear milestone. Trash does not.
World and PvP each list their single table by name and submit it automatically when opened; no dropdown or selection step is needed.

The server builds one sorted, deduplicated union of the selected tables. Each
remaining item has one chance, regardless of duplicate table IDs or overlapping
loot. Equipment must require no more than the player's current level plus three,
using the shared equip requirement calculation rather than item power. Uncommon,
rare and epic class-compatible equipment remains eligible; legendary loot does not.

No-selection, forged or partly invalid selections roll nothing. If no unique,
level-eligible items remain, the slot cannot roll and does not block claiming an
already revealed reward. Unopened slots remain available if the player waits to
level up instead of claiming. Claiming still consumes that week's other choices.
Saved items remain fixed even if the player's level or eligibility changes.

The server saves the item and its actual source in the existing `tableId` field
before revealing it. The multi-selection is transient, not stored. Retries retain
both the original item and source. View possible loot groups collapsible tables
under content categories and difficulty, with item icons, counts and tooltips.

Older records can prove final-boss kills from lifetime dungeon deeds and legacy
raid unlocks; they cannot prove intermediate kills. Legacy weeks without a boss
snapshot use those verified lifetime clears until the first new roll freezes
the snapshot. This compatibility policy does not claim to reconstruct an old
week's cutoff. Already fixed items remain unchanged and show "Previously rolled
reward" instead of a misleading table picker; the hint contains no item details.
Characters without recorded
eligible clears must earn a relevant boss clear before opening those legacy slots.

## Reset and persistence

Both the vault and Crucible call `SimContext.weeklyRaidResetMs`, injected by the
host. Online uses the realm time zone; offline uses the same default calendar:
Tuesday at 03:00 realm time, with DST. The countdown uses that exact stored boundary.
No additional scheduler or database queries are introduced.

`weekly_rewards.ts` owns current progress, persistent boss unlocks and completed
weekly batches. `raidClears` retains only the three best difficulties for the
current week; per-boss `raids` and `raidUnlocks` remain separate. Older saves
without `raidClears` recover one known clear per recorded boss, since their
repeat clears were not stored. A rollback to an older build followed by a save
loses the new repeat-clear record. A claim validates proximity, life state, the
active batch's choice
key, the echoed sequence and bag capacity before consuming a batch and granting its
fixed item. Inventory and the ledger share the existing character save. An unclean
crash can roll back unsaved gameplay, like other inventory operations.

Storage is bounded to 520 earned weeks with at most 12 candidates per week. At this
ten-year backlog limit existing choices are protected and new completed weeks cannot
be stored; the UI warns to collect rewards. Calendar progress still advances. The
wire exposes only the oldest set and backlog count, never the entire history.
Boss unlock maps accept only authored catalog IDs and tiers 1 or 2; snapshots
carry eligibility, not unopened items. There is no per-character table cache.

Prototype `pending` roll counters convert once into one legacy choice set, capped
at three candidates per row. Those counters did not retain week identities. The
optional `CharacterState.weeklyRewards` field supports old characters. Servers
predating this field drop it on save; deployment rollback requires preservation.

## World quest integration

World and Normal Nythraxis raid rolls share equipment. Duplicate prevention spans
all rows in the week. If earlier rolls reserve every usable world item, remaining
world vaults show as exhausted and do not block claiming a revealed reward.
Concealed legacy items and pending saves still need to be opened and acknowledged.
`weekly_reward_availability.ts` shares that rule between the claim gate and UI.

Landed on the quests integration branch (release v0.44.0, tracker #4086) once
PR #3847 and this vault shared a tree. `creditWorldQuest` calls
`recordWeeklyWorldQuest(ctx, pid)` immediately after writing the quest's
once-per-cycle claim token, so a completion counts exactly once and a replayed
or re-credited quest cannot count again; no client command reaches the counter.
`weeklyLootPool('world')` walks the Nythraxis raid's spawns at Normal difficulty
through the same collector the raid and dungeon rows use, without the raid-kill
gate, and applies the shared usability filter. `worldQuestsAvailable` is true
whenever that pool holds something the character's class can wear (every
shipped class today), so a class with nothing to wear would see the row
unavailable rather than an empty roll. The tier, the per-class usability and
the completion path are pinned by `tests/weekly_vault_world_row.test.ts`.

## Local playtest and render budget

Enter an offline test character and type `/dev weeklyvault`. This teleports to the
hall and replaces that character's ledger with sample current progress and one
completed week with five item choices. Select an item, inspect it, then press
Take selected item. All other choices from that week disappear.

The stone hall uses eight merged meshes, no lights or texture downloads, and the
town's existing reveal and occluder-fade machinery. Its triangles are included in
the town budget. It uses headroom above the soft target while remaining below the
unchanged hard ceiling. Placement and geometry have dedicated regression coverage.

## Opening animation

Clicking a vault runs one choreography, owned by the pure core
`src/ui/weekly_vault_burst_core.ts` (`VAULT_TIMELINE` plus the per-element ray,
star, streak and ring layout) and painted by `attachWeeklyVaultReveal`, which
stamps every number as a `--vault-*` custom property the weekly rewards section of
`src/styles/components.css` animates. In order: light leaks around the door seam
from the inside on the click (and throbs while an online host is still saving the
opening), the latch releases and the heavy door swings, then the burst fires: every
ray, star and highlight streak has its own start, life, reach and drift on a
fast-out, long-settle curve, so they leave the doorway individually. A ray is a
stroke that trims outward through a feathered mask window: its head shoots out
from the centre with a soft edge, then its tail follows the head out, soft too, so
it leaves rather than fading where it lies. Streaks
flicker in place and fade; the stars twinkle and are the last to go. Two shockwave
rings and the core bloom ride the same window. The loot icon and name pop in from
the centre of the doorway (covering the strokes there) as soon as the door has
swung far enough to show it (`doorClearMs`, about two thirds of the swing, proven
against the door's own keyframes by the styles test), while the burst is still
going, through a backwards-filled keyframe, never a transition (a transition cannot start when the
open class lands before the element's first style pass, which is how the item name
once showed over a shut door).

The bank tab repaints once shortly after the click (the ledger now carries the
opened item), which rebuilds the tile; the claim controller owns each reward's
monotonic opening start and completion state, scoped to its world and reward week.
The reveal controller stamps `--vault-elapsed` on the rebuilt stage,
and every open-state animation subtracts it from its delay, so the show resumes
where it was instead of restarting. The host marks the reveal complete at
`WEEKLY_REVEAL_DURATION_MS` after the first start (less the elapsed time on a
resumed stage), after everything has settled. An overdue repaint settles directly
without reminting the burst, and equal slot/item pairs in another session cannot
inherit its timing. Repeated clicks wait for the opening acknowledgement; a
bounded retry becomes available if no snapshot arrives, without changing the roll.
The light stays inside the card:
the tile's own overflow clip masks the burst at the card edge exactly as it masks
the swinging door, so nothing crosses into a neighbouring card; on the hinge side
the light container is clipped at the doorway's inner edge, so nothing lit ever
sits behind the open door.
Rarity colouring is untouched: every light element derives from the vault's
`--weekly-vault-glow` token and the loot keeps its `quality-*` class. Bloom and glow
scale with `--fx-shadow`; reduced motion and an already revealed vault show the
resting open state with no replay. Pinned by `tests/weekly_vault_burst_core.test.ts`,
`tests/weekly_vault_reveal_styles.test.ts` and the reveal controller suite.
