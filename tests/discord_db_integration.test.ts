// Opt-in real-Postgres coverage for the set-based Discord statements: the two
// added with POST /internal/discord/flex-batch and the members-meta bulk upsert,
// plus the batched identity read GET /internal/discord/outbox drains through.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: tests/discord_db.test.ts drives both functions through a
// fake pool that routes on SQL TEXT, so it can pin the shape, the bound
// parameters and the statement COUNT, but it never parses, plans or executes a
// line of the SQL. What ships in those two statements is unusually novel for this
// codebase (a data-modifying CTE, multi-argument unnest, a row-constructor
// IS DISTINCT FROM, array_agg over an anti-join, a LATERAL with LIMIT 1, ISO
// strings bound into timestamptz[], bigint-as-string coercion), and a syntax or
// type defect in the ONE statement that now carries the whole member sweep is a
// total outage rather than a degradation. This file is the arm that actually runs
// them. The default suite stays DB-free: set TEST_DATABASE_URL to opt in.
//
// Mirrors the admin_db_integration.test.ts / daily_rewards_db_integration.test.ts
// template: a dedicated schema, tables carrying only the columns these statements
// read, and EXPLAIN ... FORMAT JSON to pin the plan rather than only the result.
