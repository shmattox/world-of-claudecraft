// IWorld facet: World PvP, the /pvp flag (src/sim/pvp/world_pvp.ts) and the
// King of the Hill (src/sim/pvp/hill.ts). The self-scoped readouts the World
// PvP tab and the hill bar paint plus the one command that raises or lowers
// the flag. Whether ANOTHER player is flagged is not here: it rides the
// entity roster as `Entity.pvpFlag` (the `pvp` wire bit), which is what the
// nameplate and target-frame cores read, together with the zone policy of
// the ground under each player (src/sim/pvp/world_pvp_zones.ts).
//
// Offline the Sim answers from the primary player's own state; online
// ClientWorld mirrors the server's `wpvp` and `hill` self keys (delta-omitted:
// an absent key keeps the prior readout, null before the first snapshot).
