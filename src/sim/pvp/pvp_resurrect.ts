// PvP Resurrect (owner rule, 2026-10-02): a player killed in the open world with
// another player's hand in it may skip the corpse run. Their death screen offers
// "PvP Resurrect", which releases the spirit as normal (it rises at the nearest
// graveyard, the same one Release picks) and stands them straight up there at
// full health and mana with no Keeper's Toll, the battleground deal for world
// PvP. The raise itself is spirit.ts pvpResurrect, beside the other ways back.
//
// This leaf owns the RULE and the stamp: the offer is decided at death
// (worldPvpOnPlayerDeath calls notePvpResurrectAtDeath for every player death),
// and lives on the corpse as Entity.pvpResurrect until any revive clears it
// (spirit.ts reviveAt). It is never offered:
//   - on the instance plane (dungeons, raids, delves, rifts, battlegrounds,
//     arenas), which have their own way back;
//   - to a jailed player (the jail brawl is player damage too, and a graveyard
//     revive would walk them out of the cell).
// Pure apart from the one Entity write: sim clock only, no rng, no wall clock.
