// moment inside the window, a hill is announced somewhere in one of the
// northern zones; it rises HILL_WARNING_SECONDS later as a HILL_RADIUS
// circle on dry, open ground and stands for HILL_DURATION_SECONDS. The PARTY
// with the most members standing inside it contests it, holds it after
// HILL_CAPTURE_SECONDS of unbroken majority, and every holder standing inside
// earns a slow trickle of Honor for as long as they hold it. While it stands
// the realm hears where it is every HILL_NOTICE_SECONDS, with the standings
// (hill_ranking.ts): the group that held it longest earns a point toward the
// Weekly Vault's PvP row when it falls. Raid members do
// not count; every level does. No SimContext, no rng, no clock: every function here is a plain function of its arguments so the
// sim (hill.ts), the HUD bar and the tests read the same verdicts. The
// ctx-bound system that owns the schedule, the presence pass, the contest
// clock and the payouts is hill.ts.
