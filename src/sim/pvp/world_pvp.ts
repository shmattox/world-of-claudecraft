// World PvP (the /pvp flag): the system half, behind the SimContext seam.
//
// A player raises the flag with /pvp (or the World PvP tab of the PvP window)
// and becomes attackable by, and able to attack, every other flagged player
// who is not in their party or raid (a shared guild is no shield), anywhere
// the ground allows it. The ground has three answers (world_pvp_zones.ts): a
// sanctuary switches the world off for everyone in it, a free-for-all zone
// makes everyone standing in it fair game with no flag at all, and everywhere
// else is contested: the mutual-flag rule. In a free-for-all zone the first
// hit on an unflagged player MARKS the attacker (raises their flag), so an
// aggressor always ends up carrying the stake; whoever hits a flagged player,
// the victim included, is never marked for it.
//
// Lowering the flag takes WORLD_PVP_DISARM_SECONDS, and the drop waits for
// combat to end. A kill moves a gold stake (world_pvp_rules.ts worldPvpStake)
// from a FLAGGED victim's purse (an unflagged player killed in a free-for-all
// zone loses nothing) and pays a share of the honor pool to everyone who
// worked for it: the killing blow, everyone who damaged the victim inside the
// assist window, and every healer who kept one of those damagers standing.
// Healing, shielding or buffing a flagged player who is in a world fight
// raises the caster's own flag first (the classic rule), so nobody can carry a
// fight from behind a flag they do not wear. The books that remember who hit,
// healed and killed whom live on the Sim as ONE live view (`ctx.worldPvpBooks`),
// never inside this module: the modules hold functions, the Sim holds state
// (src/sim/CLAUDE.md).
//
// Authority and persistence: `PlayerMeta.worldPvp` is the truth (persisted in
// the character blob, absent until the character first raises the flag so an
// unflagged save stays byte-identical); `Entity.pvpFlag` is the display mirror
// that rides the entity wire, written ONLY here, the away.ts precedent. The
// per-pair diminishing returns are a session book keyed by the two characters'
// rename-proof identities with a WORLD_PVP_DR_WINDOW_SECONDS window from the
// first kill: a relog cannot reset them (the identity survives it), a realm
// restart does (owner tuning: an hour's window, not a calendar day).
//
// Host-agnostic: no DOM, no rng, no wall clock. The disarm clock, the assist
// window and the DR window run on `ctx.time` (tick math), so the offline Sim,
// the server, and the headless env resolve every flag and every kill
// identically.
