 *  def-level rules (soulbound/quest/noMarketList) stay with each pipe; this is
 *  only the per-copy lock. A plain copy is never locked. NOT the same axis as
 *  the PLAYER item lock (item_lock_flag.ts `locked`, issue 3042): that one is
 *  the owner's own salvage/craft/vendor safety mark, still not consulted by the
 *  gold market, Ravenpost, or the guild bank. The $WOC exchange is the one pipe
 *  that DOES honor it now (ruling R10): exchangeHardLock adds a `locked` arm, so
 *  a locked copy refuses listing while the seller can lift it in one click. */
