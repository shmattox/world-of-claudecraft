// Soul Rend release: the Nythraxis stack mechanic gives way to Bone Storm.
//
// Soul Rend asks the marked raiders to collapse onto one point so the
// detonation splits between them. Bone Storm asks the whole raid to spread and
// run from the whirl and the charges. The two cannot be answered at once: a
// storm that begins while marks are live either runs into a stacked raid
// (every raider in the huddle eats the whirl and the slam together) or forces
// the marks to resolve unstacked (a guaranteed kill on heroic). So the instant
// a storm begins, every live mark is released: the aura leaves its bearer and
// the mark deals nothing. The Soul Rend cadence itself is untouched; the next
// marks come on their normal timer once the storm ends. The other edge is a
// storm due just AFTER a detonation, when the raid is still huddled: the
// encounter arms a settle (NYTHRAXIS_SOUL_REND_SETTLE_SECONDS, read only by
// the storm cast) so the storm never opens on a freshly stacked raid.
//
// Bone Storm is retired from play (NYTHRAXIS_BONE_STORM_ENABLED), so the
// release and the settle above only matter if the switch is flipped back.
// The fire gap below is live: it keeps Grave Eruption clear of the marks.
//
// `src/sim`-pure: no rng, no wall clock, no DOM. The driver in
// encounters/nythraxis.ts calls releaseNythraxisSoulRendMarks from
// startNythraxisBoneStorm.
