// The player item-lock predicate, extracted to a dependency-free leaf so a
// module that only needs to READ the flag (exchange_eligibility.ts, the shared
// exchange lock predicate) stays a SimContext-free leaf that never imports the
// lock SYSTEM module (the set command and the removal walks), whatever
// item_lock.ts happens to import at the time. That system stays in
// item_lock.ts and re-exports this. Precedent: the same extraction
// transfer_lock.ts performs for isTransferLockedInstance.
//
// `src/sim`-pure: no imports beyond the type, no rng, no clock.
