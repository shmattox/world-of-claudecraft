# src/ui/hud/world_pvp - the World PvP tab of the merged PvP window

The `/pvp` flag's HUD surface: the fourth tab of the window on `G`
(`src/ui/arena_window.ts` composes it beside Thornhollow Fields and the two
ranked brackets). Same recipe as `src/ui/hud/battleground/`: one pure view
core plus one thin painter, behind this barrel.

- `world_pvp_window_view.ts`: the pure core (registered in `UI_PURE_CORES`).
  Turns `IWorld.worldPvpInfo` + the honor balance + the window's confirm-step
  flag into ids and numbers: the status (up / down / disarming with the
  remaining clock), the ground under the player (`zone`) and whether the realm
  runs World PvP at all (`realmEnabled`), the one action the panel offers
  (`enable`, `disable`, `keepUp`, `locked`, `realmOff`), the resolved stakes
  (`WORLD_PVP_STAKES`, read from `src/sim/pvp/world_pvp_rules.ts` so a retune
  never strands the copy, the repeat ladder through `worldPvpPairMultiplier`),
  and the render-skip signature, which carries the zone and the realm switch so
  a border crossing repaints. DOM-free, i18n-free.
  `realmOff` outranks every other action arm: the sim refuses a raise, restores
  no saved flag and auto-raises nobody on a realm whose kill switch is set, so
  the flag is always down there and the only honest button is a disabled one.
- `world_pvp_panel_controller.ts`: the painter (the `_controller` suffix files it as a cold window painter
  in the `tests/hud_perf_budget.test.ts` sweep, never a per-frame one). Localizes the
  view through `hudChrome.worldPvp.*` (plus `hudChrome.warfare.balance` for the
  honor row), formats the countdown through `clock_seconds_core.ts` and the
  percent through `formatNumber`, stamps focus keys on the action buttons so
  the once-a-second countdown rebuild hands keyboard focus back (the window
  restores through `focus_restore.ts`), and wires the buttons back through
  `IWorld.setWorldPvpFlag`. The raise is a two-step confirm (the flag exposes
  the player to a gold stake); the confirm flag itself is window state, so
  `openTab`, a strip click and `close` all clear it. The status card carries two
  lines: the flag sentence (free-for-all ground gets its own, because the
  generic one promises an immunity that ground denies) and the ground line,
  whose `.wpvp-zone` tone reads hostile on free-for-all and muted elsewhere. A
  realm with the kill switch set drops the ground line (no policy is live) and
  states the reason once, under the disabled button where the level requirement
  goes; it offers no chat hint, because `/pvp` is refused there too.
- The other player's flag is never read here: it rides `Entity.pvpFlag` and is
  the nameplate / target-frame / auto-attack gate's business
  (`src/sim/pvp/world_pvp_rules.ts` `worldPvpPairHostile`).

Cover changes in `tests/world_pvp_view.test.ts` (the core and the markup) and
`tests/pvp_tabs_view.test.ts` (the tab never pins or locks).

The played-time reward clock uses h:mm and updates its text node in place; it
does not enter the full-panel signature. Tutorial island blocks enable/keep-up;
lowering the flag remains available. The paused line names the cause the sim
sends in `WorldPvpInfo.rewardPause` (`rewardPausedDead`, `rewardPausedInstance`,
or `rewardPaused` for the sanctuary), falling back to the sanctuary rule for an
older server that sends no cause. Instance ground reads contested, so the zone
alone cannot tell an instance pause apart.
