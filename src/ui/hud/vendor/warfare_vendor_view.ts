// Pure, host-agnostic view model for the WARFARE quartermaster's shop window.
//
// The pure-core half of the pure-core + thin-consumer split (reference
// heroic_vendor_view.ts): it decides how the honor stock DIVIDES into sections,
// which offers the viewer already owns, which set bonus tiers are live, and how
// many more pieces the next unmet tier still wants. The DOM/i18n side lives in
// warfare_vendor_window.ts. DOM-free and i18n-free so
// tests/warfare_vendor_view.test.ts can drive it directly.
//
// Why this window exists at all: the ordinary vendor grid renders the whole stock
// as one flat list, with no indication that five of the families are sets and no
// grouping to buy a family from. The SECTIONING is the point of the window; the
// bonus text lives in the item tooltip, where every raid tier set already shows
// it (see the header of warfare_vendor_window.ts for what this deliberately does
// not paint, and why the tiers / ownedPieces / nextTier fields below survive
// anyway).
